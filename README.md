# Bo# 🧩 Botium Toys Internal IT Audit Project
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
**Focus:** Risk Assessment • Compliance • Governance • PCI DSS • GDPR  
**Type:** Simulated Internal Audit Case Study  

---

### 📘 Overview
This project simulates an **internal cybersecurity audit** for *Botium Toys*, a small U.S.-based toy company expanding its online presence to international markets.  
The audit evaluates the company’s **IT infrastructure**, **risk posture**, and **compliance** readiness using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as a guide.

The purpose of this audit is to identify potential **security gaps**, assess **regulatory risks** (e.g., PCI DSS and GDPR), and provide **actionable recommendations** to strengthen operational security.

---

### ⚙️ Audit Objectives
1. Establish an audit scope aligned with NIST CSF core functions: *Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.*  
2. Create an inventory of all critical IT assets managed by the organization.  
3. Conduct a structured risk assessment identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and impact levels.  
4. Map existing controls to compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, GDPR).  
5. Provide prioritized recommendations for improving cybersecurity posture and governance.

### 🧩 Key Findings (Example Summary)
> *These are example points — replace with your actual analysis once you complete the audit.*

- Identified **gaps in network monitoring** and **lack of centralized log management**.  
- **Unpatched systems** increase vulnerability to ransomware and data breaches.  
- **Limited access controls** in payment systems raise PCI DSS compliance concerns.  
- **Data retention and privacy practices** require alignment with GDPR requirements.  

---

### 💡 Recommendations
- Implement centralized **SIEM** for event correlation and intrusion detection.  
- Develop a **patch management policy** and schedule.  
- Conduct **PCI DSS gap analysis** for payment systems.  
- Introduce **data protection policies** addressing EU customers’ personal information.  
- Perform **annual internal audits** and **quarterly vulnerability scans**.
