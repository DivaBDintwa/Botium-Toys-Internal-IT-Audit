# Bo# üß© Botium Toys Internal IT Audit Project
**Framework:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
**Focus:** Risk Assessment ‚Ä¢ Compliance ‚Ä¢ Governance ‚Ä¢ PCI DSS ‚Ä¢ GDPR  
**Type:** Simulated Internal Audit Case Study  

---

### üìò Overview
This project simulates an **internal cybersecurity audit** for *Botium Toys*, a small U.S.-based toy company expanding its online presence to international markets.  
The audit evaluates the company‚Äôs **IT infrastructure**, **risk posture**, and **compliance** readiness using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as a guide.

The purpose of this audit is to identify potential **security gaps**, assess **regulatory risks** (e.g., PCI DSS and GDPR), and provide **actionable recommendations** to strengthen operational security.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Audit Objectives
1. Establish an audit scope aligned with NIST CSF core functions: *Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.*  
2. Create an inventory of all critical IT assets managed by the organization.  
3. Conduct a structured risk assessment identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and impact levels.  
4. Map existing controls to compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, GDPR).  
5. Provide prioritized recommendations for improving cybersecurity posture and governance.

### üß© Key Findings 

- Identified **gaps in network monitoring** and **lack of centralized log management**.   
- **Inadequate data security and encryption** raise PCI DSS compliance concerns.  
- **Data retention and privacy practices** require alignment with GDPR requirements.
- **Inadequate management of assets and data** as there is no encryption and the principle of least priviledge is not implemented
- **Lack of compliance to regulations** such as the GBPR
- **Absence of disaster recovery plans** and no backups of important data
- **Absence of SIEM tools** that ensure business continuity

---

### üí° Recommendations
- Implement centralized **SIEM** for event correlation,password management and intrusion detection.  
- Develop a **patch management policy** and schedule.  
- Conduct **PCI DSS gap analysis** for payment systems.  
- Introduce **data protection policies** addressing EU customers‚Äô personal information.  
- Perform **annual internal audits** and **quarterly vulnerability scans**.
- Implement principles of **least privilege** and **separation of duties**
